This is my implementation of the multiplayer game called Agario (agar.io).

Uses Node.js and Socket.io to run the server.

How to run application:

1.) run Node server.js in terminal/cmd prompt
2.) open a browser and type in the url 127.0.0.01:3000

You can also try opening multiple browsers and seeing multiple people playing in the same game!
